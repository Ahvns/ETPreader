# Introduction to Stata Programming

This repository contains a reader on programming in Stata.
I've written it for AEclipse's Erasmus Thesis Project,
aimed at both Bachelor and Master students of Erasmus School of Economics writing their thesis.

The reader is currently a work in progress and I plan on adding more information about it here along the way.
