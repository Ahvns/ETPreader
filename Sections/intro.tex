Reader with advanced tips and tricks for Stata.
I'll add some introductory text about the reader here.
Incomplete sections will have a very short description of what will be described in them.
Could include some information about the thesis project, AEclipse, and maybe myself.
I assume some knowledge of and/or experience with both Stata and programming in general.
Example do-files will be available on the reader's \href{https://github.com/Ahvns/ETPreader}{GitHub page}.
Comments and feedback are always welcome.
