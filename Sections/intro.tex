Reader with advanced tips and tricks for Stata.
I'll add some introductory text about the reader here.
Incomplete sections will have a very short description of what will be described in them.
Could include some information about the thesis project, AEclipse, and maybe myself.
I assume some knowledge of and/or experience with both Stata and programming in general.
Any questions, comments, or feedback on this reader or AEclipse's Erasmus Thesis Project in general can be sent to \href{mailto:thesisproject@aeclipse.nl}{thesisproject@aeclipse.nl}.

\paragraph{Example code}
This reader contains several pieces of example code.
All code has been written so that it can be copy-pasted to a do-file and run using Stata as is,
unless specified otherwise.
All example code is also available as separate do-files on the reader's GitHub page \href{https://github.com/Ahvns/ETPreader/tree/main/Example%20do-files}{here}.
Note that some of the code in the reader contains automatically generated linebreaks,
which might be included if you copy and paste the code into a do-file yourself.
If any of the code doesn't work,
please check if any command is broken up into multiple lines where it should not be and fix this.
If the code still doesn't work, I've likely made a mistake --
please let me know if this happens!

\paragraph{Acknowledgements}
I plan to add some acknowledgements here later.
